    ECMAScript 6 (ES6) introduced two new keywords for variable declaration: `let` and `const`. These keywords provide block scope, which is different from the function scope of `var`. This means that variables declared with `let` and `const` are only accessible within the block they are defined in, making them more predictable and reducing the risk of variable name collisions.
